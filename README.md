## Summary

[![QTE 0.9b overview](https://i.imgur.com/1knC5wF.jpeg)](https://i.imgur.com/1knC5wF.jpeg)

QTE lets you bind hotkeys for common actions on text strips, like setting colour or location. This is helpful if you have a lot of text sequences, such as for subtitles.

## Installation

Download quicker-text-editing.py from the releases section, then add it to Blender from Preferences > Add-ons > Install... (from file)

[//]: <> (TODO check this)

QTE was developed against the [Blender 3.3 API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html), and has not been tested with earlier versions. If you are on an earlier version, either upgrade or use at your own risk!

## Usage

To add an action, go to Preferences > Add-ons, make sure 'Quicker text editing for VSE' is enabled, then add a colour, location, size or duration preset. You can then set what it to be applied (eg a colour), and the key combo to apply this.

## Roadmap

The following features are one of: planned, nice-to-have, or pie-in-the-sky. Not all have been evaulated for how feasible they are.

- change focus to new text sequence when copying and pasting a strip
- quick focus on text property in sidebar for entering text
- auto-size text to fit screen

## Background and Development

Improvements, feature suggestions and PRs are very welcome.

If you want to know more about the background for this addon, I have a [series of posts](https://blog.roberthallam.org/tag/qte) that cover the why, how and what.
